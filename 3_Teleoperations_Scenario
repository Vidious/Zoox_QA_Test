As the safety of 1.2 million humans are at risk of an autonomous fleet – The number of teleoperators would have to be at a minimum of a 1:1 ratio of teleoperator to active autonomous fleet vehicle. Ideally, each vehicle could have 2 teleoperators, or at least one operator with dual backup connections to the vehicle for fast reactions to emergencies.

However, not every vehicle would likely be active at the same time. Teleoperators could switch between multiple vehicles if some are down/disabled for any reason.

The vehicles will also need to stop, or shut down for repairs at some points.

Teleoperators will need to be able to detect alerts for emergency vehicles in case the autonomous vehicle fails to detect it for any reason, such as signal interference.

Teleoperators should also look for vehicles that are supposed to be active, but appear not to be moving. Access to local traffic cameras, or a drone attached to the vehicle could assist in identifying issues like this.

Factors to consider:

•	Number of active autonomous vehicles
•	Detecting when a sensor is not functioning on one of the vehicles to disable it
•	Sending a tow truck to retrieve vehicles stranded due to mechanical/outside causes that disable it’s function
•	Teleoperations connection speed
•	Teleoperations connection back up, and reliability
•	Traffic camera/drone camera access
•	Thieves who try to strip the vehicle for parts
•	Hours each vehicle is active
•	Scheduled maintenance per vehicle
•	Unscheduled maintenance per vehicle
•	Required re-fueling stops per vehicle
•	Tier/tread wear
•	Ability to respond/assist with active passenger needs/requests
•	Users with disabilities/special needs
•	Users who speak other languages
•	Weather activity in the city
•	Traffic density
•	Other active systems active in the area
o	Trolleys
o	Competitor autonomous vehicles
o	Wifi signals
o	Bluetooth signals
o	Mobile devices
o	Signal traffic from other electronics
•	Connection to local emergency services
o	Ambulance
o	Fire
o	Police
